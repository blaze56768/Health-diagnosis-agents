# Medical Case Analysis by Agents

<img width="900" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7c87bf6-dfff-42fe-b8d1-9be9e6c7ce86">

This repository showcases a Python-based system that leverages multiple LLM-powered AI agents to examine complex medical case reports.
Each agent simulates the perspective of a different medical specialist, and together they produce a more holistic interpretation of a patient’s condition.

The project highlights how collaborative AI agents can assist in multidisciplinary medical reasoning and exploratory diagnostics.

⚠️ Important Notice
This project is strictly intended for research, learning, and experimentation.
It must not be used for real-world medical diagnosis or clinical decision-making.

## 🧠 System Overview

The current implementation uses three specialized AI agents, all powered by GPT-5.
A medical report is shared with each agent simultaneously using parallel execution (threading).
Once all agents complete their analysis, their outputs are aggregated and distilled into three likely health concerns, each supported by explanatory reasoning.

## Specialized Agents

### 1. Cardiologist Agent

Role: Evaluates potential heart-related problems such as rhythm irregularities or structural issues.

Outputs: Suggestions for cardiac tests, monitoring approaches, and possible interventions.

### 2. Psychologist Agent

Role: Examines mental and emotional factors, including anxiety-related or stress-induced conditions.

Outputs: Recommendations around therapy options, lifestyle adjustments, or psychological assessments.

### 3. Pulmonologist Agent

Role: Focuses on respiratory system evaluation, looking for conditions like asthma or breathing dysfunctions.

Outputs: Advice on pulmonary tests, breathing techniques, and respiratory care strategies.

## ⚡ Quickstart

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmadvh/AI-Agents-for-Medical-Diagnostics.git
   cd AI-Agents-for-Medical-Diagnostics
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Set up your API credentials:**
    - Create a file named apikey.env in the project root.
    - Add your OpenAI (or other LLM provider) credentials:
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
4. **Run the system:** `python main.py`

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmadvh/AI-Agents-for-Medical-Diagnostics.git
cd AI-Agents-for-Medical-Diagnostics
```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure API access
Create an apikey.env file in the root directory.
Add your API key (OpenAI or another supported provider):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Run the application
`python main.py`
